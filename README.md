# ThinkSpace Concept Repository

This repository documents the early-stage concept and product requirements for **ThinkSpace**, a minimalist daily reflection app. The goal is to design a calm companion that delivers one universal prompt, a concise set of curated readings, and serene literary spaces that respect the user’s time and privacy.

## Contents
- [`docs/thinkspace_product_spec.md`](docs/thinkspace_product_spec.md): Comprehensive product specification covering vision, personas, features, architecture, AI curation workflow, and roadmap.

## Getting Started
These materials are intended for product, design, and engineering teams exploring the ThinkSpace concept. Suggested next steps include:
1. Review the product specification to align on scope and guiding principles.
2. Translate the specification into low-fidelity prototypes (Figma, wireframes).
3. Validate assumptions with potential users focused on reflective reading habits.
4. Choose technology stack and outline implementation milestones based on the phased roadmap.

## Contribution Guidelines
- Propose edits via pull requests with clear rationale.
- Keep documentation focused on calm, private-first experiences—avoid introducing social features or engagement loops that conflict with the product ethos.
- When adding new documents, update this README to maintain an accurate table of contents.
