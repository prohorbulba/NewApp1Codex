# ThinkSpace Product Specification

## 1. Vision
ThinkSpace is a minimalist daily companion that delivers a single thoughtful prompt, curated knowledge, and serene reading spaces. The experience is intentionally quiet, private, and finite: the goal is to help people pause, reflect, and explore a few meaningful ideas each day rather than scroll endlessly. ThinkSpace should feel like opening a beautifully edited journal that respects the user’s time and attention.

## 2. Guiding Principles
- **One-digestible-dose design:** The app offers one prompt, a handful of short readings, and a slim news digest per day. No infinite feeds.
- **Calm visual language:** A restrained typography-first interface, neutral colors, and generous whitespace emulate the feel of a private library or classic journal.
- **Privacy and ownership:** Reflections never leave the device unless explicitly exported. Content is meant to be personal, not performative.
- **Respect for curiosity:** Content is curated to spark thinking and cross-disciplinary connections. The app inspires exploration without overwhelming the reader with options.

## 3. Target Personas
1. **Reflective Professional**
   - Values daily routines that nurture clarity and perspective.
   - Wants a distraction-free space to think without social noise.
2. **Curious Generalist**
   - Enjoys science, history, literature, and culture.
   - Prefers well-edited content over algorithmic feeds.
3. **Student of Thought**
   - Uses the prompt and readings as inspiration for journaling or creative work.
   - Appreciates optional guidance without being given answers.

## 4. Daily Flow
1. **Morning Entry**
   - Launch app → landing view shows Daily Prompt card.

3. **Optional Deep Dives**
   - News cards and literature entries can open a focused reader view with slightly longer context but still concise.
4. **Evening Return**

3. **Backend Services**
   - GraphQL or REST API delivering daily content bundles (prompt, articles, news, literature, aura items).
   - Content Management System for editors (could be headless CMS like Sanity, Contentful, or custom admin with Strapi).
   - Scheduled jobs to assemble daily bundle and push notifications.
4. **AI Services**

## 9. UX & Visual Design Notes
- Typography-focused layout with large serif for prompts, sans-serif body text.
- Neutral color palette (warm whites, charcoal text) with accent color for interactive elements.
- Card-based home layout with subtle drop shadows and ample spacing.
- Reader view mimics book margins, includes reading progress indicator.
- Gestures: swipe horizontally to navigate between daily cards, vertical scroll within content.
- Accessibility: dynamic type support, high-contrast mode, screen reader labels for all interactive elements.

## 10. Analytics & Success Metrics
- **Engagement**: Daily active users, completion rate of prompt reading, reflections created per user.
- **Retention**: 7-day and 30-day retention, streaks of consecutive days visited (tracked privately, no public badges).
- **Content Resonance**: In-app survey opt-in to rate prompt resonance (binary or slider) without social proof.
- **Qualitative Feedback**: Periodic in-app feedback request limited to once per month.

## 11. Roadmap & Phasing
- **Phase 1 (Core)**
  - Daily Prompt delivery and local Journal with encryption.
  - Curated Article module and News Digest cards.
  - Basic notifications, offline caching.
- **Phase 2**
  - Literature reader with progress tracking.
  - Historical Moment and Image of the Day features.
  - Enhanced library with archives and search.
- **Phase 3**
  - On-device Reflection Insights and theme detection.
  - Reverse Prompt cadence control, themed weeks/months.
  - Optional web client and sync accounts.

## 12. Open Questions & Risks
- **Content Licensing**: Securing rights for curated articles beyond public domain; may require partnerships or abstract summaries.
- **AI Transparency**: Communicating AI involvement without eroding trust; need clear labeling and easy feedback mechanisms.
- **Local-First Complexity**: Balancing privacy with optional sync; encryption key recovery if user loses device.
- **Editor Workflow**: Building or adopting a CMS that supports scheduling, AI-assisted drafts, and manual overrides.

## 13. Next Steps
1. Conduct lightweight user interviews to validate personas and daily flow.
2. Prototype home screen and reader interactions in Figma to test visual tone.
3. Evaluate CMS options and AI summarization providers for cost and reliability.
4. Define content calendar for first 60 days of prompts and readings.
5. Draft privacy policy and messaging around local-first design.
